            <p>I found a love for me
            Oh, darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
            Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
            Oh, I never knew you were the someone waitin' for me
            'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love, not knowin' what it was
            I will not give you up this time
            Oh, darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
            And in your eyes, you're holding mine
            Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
            Barefoot on the grass while listenin' to our favourite song
            When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
            But you heard it, "Darling, you look perfect tonight"
            Well, I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
            She shares my dreams, I hope that someday, I'll share her home
            I found a love to carry more than just my secrets
            To carry love, to carry children of our own
            We are still kids, but we're so in love, fightin' against all odds
            I know we'll be alright this time
            Darling, just hold my hand, be my girl, I'll be your man
            I see my future in your eyes
            Oh, baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
            Barefoot on the grass while listenin' to our favourite song
            When I saw you in that dress, lookin' so beautiful
            I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight
            No, no, no
            Mm, oh
            Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
            Barefoot on the grass, oh, listenin' to our favourite song
            I have faith in what I see, now I know I have met
            An angel in person, and she looks perfect
            Though I don't deserve this, you look perfect tonight</p>
